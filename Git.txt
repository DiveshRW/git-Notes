2)staged (All files that need to be commit)
   - git add filename-> to add files in staging area
   -git add -A->add all files in staging area
   |

-git commit -a -m "skip staging area and directly commit"  =>to directly commit files.

-git rm --cached filename--> to send file to untracted from commit or from staging state
-git rm--> To remove file permanently.

- git status -s
M->with green shows file modified in staging 
M->with red show file modified in working directory

- .gitignore -> include files which we don't want to add to github.  
--> create .gitignore file.
 - It will ignorws all the files declared inside this file

- Want to ignore files with particular extension (inside .gitignore)
   *.log

- To ignore file in root directory where .gitignore file is. And not in folders
- To ignore a folder --> /folderName


==> Branches
   Create a copy and work on it without effect on original 
   (Bydefault Main branch is Master)

  - Create new branch
   -git branch NewBranchName
   -git branch -> list all branches.

 - Switch to another branch
   -git checkout branchname
=====================================================================================
git push -u origin master => push changes in github
